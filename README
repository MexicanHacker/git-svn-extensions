Description: git-svn-extensions are a set of shell scripts that make it easier 
to work with subversion from git.

* Installation *

The current extensions are written as a set of bash functions. Simply add the
following line to your .bashrc or similar to take advantage of these features

 . /path/to/this/project/source.sh

* Usage *

- creating a subversion branch

  $ git-svn-create-branch branch_name

  This will create a branch in svn with that name, and check it out locally as
  svn-branch_name

- deleting a subversion branch

  $ git-svn-delete-branch branch_name

- removing remote branches that no longer exist in svn

  $ git-svn-prune-branches # shows what would be removed
  $ git-svn-prune-branches -f # actually removes those branches

- list svn branches (excluding trunk and tags/)

  $ git-svn-branches
